Project Details (instructions):

Compulsory Task
For this project, you are required to create a website which must adhere to
the given requirements. However, the rest of the implementation is entirely
up to you, so get creative!

Follow these steps:
  ●   Read through the tutorial for Django here to reinforce your
      knowledge of the basic Django concepts introduced in previous
      tasks.
  ●   We require you to build a small website (for example, a simple site
      for a fictional band, or political candidate) using Django.
  ●   Ensure your site has at least 3 pages and at least 1
      database-driven component. You are welcome to draw ideas
      from our website (http://hyperiondev.com)
  ●   Include user login and authentication.
  ●   Try to make your submission as comprehensive as possible as this
      will form part of your personal online portfolio.

Author notes:
The wibesite was created with input from the owner of the company, Love Is In The Hair.
